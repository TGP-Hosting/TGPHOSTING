                    "text2": "Rule 1 Mesh Biting:Putting a dinos head inside of the mesh and proceeding to attack is considered mesh biting, using this tactic in defence of a cave is unacceptable (Your dino will be given to your enemies as punishment), Rule 2 - Caging: You are allowed to cage a player for up to an hour. If you get caged, submit a ticket. Rule 3 - Box Platforms: You are only permitted to build a box around the rider of a dino. Any attempts to seal the dino in structures will result in a tribe wipe. Rule 4 - Cheating/Hacking/Exploits:This isn't single player, anyone caught using Cheats, Hacks or Exploits will be permanently removed from our cluster with no chance at appeal (Absolutely unacceptable and ruins the game). Rule 5 - Bullying/Grieving: This includes but isnt limited to - Harassing a single player or tribe constantly, Refusing to leave someone alone to rebuild after a raid, Picking on new players (beach bobs), Insulting beyond banter (taking shit personal)We defend the bobs on this server!thanks. Rule 6 - Tame Sniping: We do not allow player Tame sniping someone's dinosaurs left at their base unless you have built a fob and are attempting a raid/base PVP (To Be clear - No raid base/fob means No Tame Sniping. THIS RULE APPLYS TO DINOS IN SOMEONES BASE). ",

Rule 2 - Meshing: Any form of building within the mesh whether as little as a foundation to block building all the way to a full blown base is completely and utterly unacceptable (You will be season banned at a minimum). Rule 3 - Teleporters: Teleporters are okay near banned locations so long as they are NOT blocking the area.  If your teleporter is deemed too close to resources or effecting other players it will be red gunned without warning (Anywhere that isn't a banned location is fair game for teleporters). Rule 4 - Spam: Do not go crazy with spam, keep everything within render of your closest turret tower (not including shitty little pill boxes). Rule 5 - Fortnite: No playing fortnite and building up into someone else's base. Clear the spam. First!. Rule 6 - Base Spots: If you need a chair, sleeping bag, grapple hook or any other strange obscure method of entering your base, it is illegal (This will result in an instant red gun!).",
                    "text4": "Rule 1 - Tribe Limits & Name: Tribes are limited to 6 persons with no allies. This means you are required to have a consistent roster of tribe members and the same name across all of our servers. If they are in your tribe on The Island then they must also be in your tribe on Scorched Earth (6 man max, No Allies, No Exceptions). Rule 2 - Teaming: If you are caught teaming with another tribe, this includes but is not limited to helping another tribe to either raid or defend from a raid, coming to the aid of another in a PvP manner (Avoiding conflict, PVE and trading is not illegal). Rule 3  - Insiding & Reverse Insiding: All tribes belong to the OWNER of the tribe, this means if it is your decision to leave a tribe then you are required to only take what is given/permitted by the owner of said tribe. If you are being kicked/removed from your tribe, it is the responsibility of an owner to provide fair compensation for your efforts towards the tribe (please treat each other with respect and dignity, don't invite strangers). Rule 4 - Report Rule breaking: If you find yourself in a sticky situation where one of your tribe mates are breaking the rules. Submit a ticket to our team, we will happily provide immunity to any tribe members not involved in any bannable offence, So long as they didn't sit back and watch/let it happen (While we do not expect you to snitch on your friends, you cant get mad if they get you banned).
